# EyesDiseasesClassification

**Eyes diseases classfication task by CNN**

This project is included in "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" course provided by Kyiv-Mohyla Academy University and Grid Dynamics. 
The purpose of the project is an implementation of eyes diseases classification by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used in the project is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification/data">Eyes Diseases Classification by Guna Venkat Doddi<a/>.
